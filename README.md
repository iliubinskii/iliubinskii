## About

Welcome to my GitHub profile. Below, I have listed the most valuable of my works based solely on my judgment.

## Zero Company project

Zero Company is a collaborative project currently supported by four active members. We envision Zero Company as a comprehensive business environment for startup teams, potential collaborators, and angel investors. Our goal is to borrow corporate practices from the world of big business, adapt them, and reintroduce them in a way that is useful and accessible for emerging businesses. To ensure the legal validity of business interactions between our users, we will utilize a base of legal templates and a digital contract signing mechanism that complies with international standards such as GDPR, eIDAS, UETA, and ESIGN.
